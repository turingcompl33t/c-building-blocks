// Background:
//
// A binary tree is a node-based data structure that,
// as the name suggests, has properties that make it
// appear similar to a tree (i.e. the ones outside).
// More imporantly, however, is the fact that trees are
// fundamentally imporant data structures in programming
// and computer science because of their performance 
// properties - namely that, in the expected case, 
// operations on the tree (e.g. insert, find remove)
// take time that scales with the logarithm of the 
// number of items in the tree (that is O(log(n))).
// Compare this with data stuctures such as linked-lists
// and arrays where such operations might take time
// that scales linearly with the number of items
// (which is O(n)). This may not seem like a huge 
// improvement until you look at a graph of linear growth
// verus logarithmic growth for large values of n. 
// The benefits should be clear, and hopefully that
// is sufficiently motivating.
//
// Each node in the tree tracks three relationships:
// 
//	- Parent: the node appearing "above" it in the tree
//	- Left Child: one node appearing "below" it in the tree
// 	- Right Child: one node appearing "below" it in the tree
//
// The "binary" part of the binary tree's name comes from the
// fact that it only maintains two child relationships. One 
// might imagine other tree designs wherein the tree might 
// maintain an arbitrary number of children, but here we stick
// with two for the binary tree.
// 
// The tree itself is composed of a root node which forms
// the base of the tree, and from there all relationships 
// are managed by individual nodes.
//
// In this module, we implement a specific type of binary tree
// called a "binary search tree" (BST). A BST has all the
// properties of a binary tree, plus some additional requirements:
//
// - The value associated with every node in the left subtree 
//   of a node in a binary search tree is LESS than the value 
//   associated with the node itself
// - Similarly, the value associated with every node in the right 
//   subtree of a node in a binary search tree is GREATER than 
//   the value associated with the node itself  
// - Finally, both the left and right subtrees of every node in a
//   binary search tree are themselves binary search trees (they
//   also meet the above requirements)
//
// Binary trees, and binary search trees in particular, are perfect
// candidates for the application of recursive algorithms in order
// to implement necessary operations. That is, in order to implement
// an effective operation a binary search tree, work out how you might
// express the operation in terms of individual nodes and the relationships
// they have with the two subtrees below them. That way, you can apply a
// base case (of sorts) to the current node, and, if necessary, recurse
// on the left and right subtrees of the current node to effectively
// implement an algorithm on an entire tree.

// - otherwise, the given key ALREADY EXISTS in the tree,

// into it. That is, it is entirely possible for users to 
// invalidate pointers that are stored in this map from
// outside the map itself. The map cannot protect against this
// because it accepts only generic arguments. 
// 
// Arguments:
//	tree  - pointer to existing tree data structure
//	key   - the key under which to insert
//  value - the value to associate with the given key
//  out   - set to previous value if key collision occurs
//
// Returns:

// In the event that the given key is a valid key
// into the tree, this function destroys the value
// associated with `key` using the user-provided 
// delete function and removes the key from the tree.
//
// NOTE: The semantics of this tree are such that it
// will never try to destroy a key type that it maintains.
// This is to account for the most common cases in which
// types such as integral types or strings (static) are
// used as keys into the map. 
//
// Arguments:

//  `false` otherwise
